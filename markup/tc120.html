      <h3>1971 Suzuki TC120</h3>

      <!-- <p>serial nums, paint, brochure</p> -->

      <p>Picked up this little beauty in December 2016 in Seattle. It's a 1971 Suzuki TC120R Trail Cat. At least I think it
        is. I bought it on a bill of sale as a 71, no title available.</p>
      <p>From what I can tell it appears to be mostly original but there are a lot of missing parts. It has a 1969 gas tank
        despite being a 1971 model. Even without a battery, air filter, or working oil pump it fires right up and runs well.
        The 2-stroke oil is mixed in the gas since the oil pump is not hooked up.</p>
      <p>Is it really a 71? The first model year for the TC120 was 1969 and the last was 1971. The three models are:</p>
      <p>1969: TC120 1970: TC120-II 1971: TC120R</p>
      <p>Back in 1971 motorcycles did not have the standard VIN we see today. I have found several sources that list serial
        numbers for 1971 models onward but not any good references for the 1969 and 1970 model years of the TC120. The refrences
        I have found for 1971 serial numbers are from insurance related publications used to investigate theft and fraud.
        for 1971:</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Model</th>
          <th>Frame</th>
          <th>Engine</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TC120R</td>
          <td>TC120-28133</td>
          <td>TC120-16439</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <P>My TC120 frame# starts with 29 and the engine with 18. According to the serial number chart, both numbers are correct
        for the 71 model year. The manufacture date on my frame is 11/70 which would make sense for a 71 model. So yes, from
        all I can tell it is a 1971 TC120R.</p>

      <p>I was lucky enough to pick up a 1971 TC120 Parts Catalogue which lists all the parts for all three model years. Based
        on part numbers I can say that there seems to be very few differences between the three models and almost none between
        70 and 71. The most striking differences are the visuals. Each model year had unique gas tank colors and pin striping.
        The tank emblems were identical for 69 and 70 while 71 had a different tank emblem and no pin stripes. The black
        No. 019 color listed in the chart to the left I believe to be the frame color which is black for all three model
        years. So no black tanks for these bikes as far as I can tell.</p>

      <p>The other obvious visual difference is the exhaust pipe. The parts catalogue lists a different part number for 1969
        vs 70/71. It does not detail the differences, but from pictures on the web it appears that the exhaust pipe was chrome
        in 69 and black in 70/71. All three model years had an identical chrome exhaust cover.</p>

      <p>Why this bike and what are my plans for the bike?</p>
      <p>Why is easy. Saw it for cheap on the interwebs and was curious because I had never heard of this bike before. After
        a little research I found this quote in an original sales brochure for the bike:</p>
      <p>"Posi-Select transmission. 3 speeds for street. Flip the lever and 3 new speeds for the trail. Very wide torque range."</p>
      <p>First time I have come across a bike with dual-range transmission. Seems quirky and I love quirky. Checked it out,
        seller was cool, we made a deal we both were happy with.</p>
      <p>As for plans - I like fiddling with bikes and restoring them as best I can. I am going to start by finding as many
        original parts as I can to replace the missing ones. Once I have found lights for the bike I will ride it around
        for a while to make sure it's running okay. At some point I will tear it down, clean it up, and put it all back together.
        I plan on getting a title for the bike and will list the steps for that as well. I'll track my progress on this site.</p>

      <h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
      <p>Plan is to do a full restoration on this bike.</p>
